            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>
                Environmental protection is the practice of protecting the natural environment by individuals, groups and governments. Its objectives are to conserve natural resources and the existing natural environment and, where it is possible, to repair damage and reverse trends.

Due to the pressures of overconsumption, population growth and technology, the biophysical environment is being degraded, sometimes permanently. This has been recognized, and governments have begun placing restraints on activities that cause environmental degradation. Since the 1960s, environmental movements have created more awareness of the multiple environmental problems. There is disagreement on the extent of the environmental impact of human activity, so protection measures are occasionally debated.

            <h2>Challenges</h2>
            <h3>Challenge-1 : Understanding Anthropogenically Modified Systems</h3>
            <p>
                Initial accounts focused on ecosystem services provided by natural systems (Westman, 1977; Daily, 1997), while ecosystem services associated to managed ecosystems have only received attention later (e.g., Tylianakis et al., 2007). Ecologists need to communicate that the concept of ecosystem services is useful to understand how management of human-modified landscapes affect both the production of goods and environmental externalities. For ecologists working in such anthropogenically modified systems (e.g., agricultural landscapes, production forest or urban areas) challenges arise in (i) the identification of human impact on service-providing units and associated ecosystem services and (ii) considering effects of landscapes surrounding land units that provide ecosystem services.
            </p>
            <h3>Challenge-2 : Assessing Ecosystem Services</h3>
            <p>Instruments for assessing ecosystem services, including quantification, mapping and modeling, are a matter of debate in ecosystem service research (e.g., Carpenter et al., 2009; Feld et al., 2009; Hou et al., 2013). From the perspective of an ecologist challenges in assessing ecosystem services arise from the need (i) to evaluate relationships between services and the kind of measures usually collected in ecological studies (e.g., species richness) and (ii) to account for the characteristics of ecological processes (e.g., dynamics, feedbacks, and uncertainties) in statistical models focusing on service provision.</p>
            <h3>Challenge-3 : Analyzing Relationships between Ecosystem Services</h3>
            <p>Ecosystem services may demonstrate joint variation, either synergistic or antagonistic, in space and time. The interpretation of such patterns between multiple ecosystem services (more than two) has become an intensively debated subject (Cimon-Morin et al., 2013) and multi-ecosystem service models that link service provision and trade-offs are rapidly emerging (for a review see Nelson and Daily, 2010). Such joint variation may also concern relationships between beneficial ecosystem services and so called ecosystem disservices, for example environmental externalities such as water pollution (Zhang et al., 2007).</p>

            <h2>Conservation Efforts</h2>
            <p>
                <b>1.Ecosystem Monitoring</b>:A complex and adaptive ecosystem in which all the chemical, physical, and biological components, functions, and processes are intact and functioning normally is considered a healthy ecosystem (but see Cumming and Cumming (2015), for a discussion on this value-based term). In contrast, disturbing any of an ecosystem’s components, functions, and/or processes will, by definition, alter them to some degree. In many cases, ecosystems that have been exposed to certain forms and levels of disturbances remain healthy because there is redundancy in the roles performed by different ecosystem components. This ability of an ecosystem to withstand certain forms and levels of disturbances is referred to as ecosystem stability. Ecosystem stability could be the result of one or both of two qualities: resistance and resilience.                 
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>2.Restoring damaged Ecosystems</b>:Ecosystems are regularly disturbed by natural phenomena such as floods from cyclones/hurricanes, or wildfires started by lightning. Nevertheless, natural disturbances typically lead to succession and a return to ecological conditions that can sustain high levels of biodiversity. In contrast, ecosystems that humans have damaged or destroyed through activities such as unsustainable agriculture and deforestation, overgrazing, or pollution tend to lose their ability to rebound without human intervention.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>3.Maintaining Complex and Adaptive Ecosystems</b>:Even when monitoring data show that an ecosystem is healthy, management is often required to maintain those desired conditions. That is because very few ecosystems are completely free of human influences. For example, rivers and streams carry pollutants far beyond the point of contamination and roads acting as firebreaks suppress natural fire regimes. Today, even the most isolated patches of habitats may not be completely protected from the influences of global processes such as climate change. To maintain complex and adaptive ecosystems, conservation biology is guided by four complementary management principles: (1) maintain ecosystem processes, (2) minimise external threats, (3) be adaptive, and (4) be minimally intrusive.

            <h2>Get Involved</h2>
            <p>
                Here, we list the top 5 NGOs in India that are involved in protecting our environment through various methods.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>1.Ashoka Trust for Research in Ecology and the Environment (ATREE)</b>:The organisation has been working on social-environmental issues from local to global policy levels for almost two decades. It envisions a society committed to environmental protection and conservation on earth and stands for sustainable and socially-just development. It works closely with policymakers, environmental leaders and also builds an army of next-generation environment warriors through its academic programmes, studies and workshops.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>2.Chintan Environmental Research and Action Group</b>:Focussed on promoting sustainable and equitable growth for every member of society, Chintan works towards ensuring responsible and sustainable consumption, thus protecting the environment. Chintan endeavours to lessen surplus waste, promote sustainable consumption and facilitate better waste management. 
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>3.SankalpTaru Foundation</b>:This NGO has used digital channels to protect and conserve the environment. SankalpTaru is an e-NGO, which aims at promoting tree plantations across the country. The plantation drive is run on a digital platform, allowing SankalpTaru to use innovative technologies such as GPS-tagging. 
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>4.Mukti</b>:In the midst of the Sunderbans of West Bengal, one of the most extensive mangrove forests in the world, Mukti works for the region’s social and economic development and environmental protection. Mukti has been operating in the Sunderbans for almost two decades, working in poverty alleviation, education, livelihood, environment and other areas.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>5.Janmitram Kalyan Samiti</b>:Literally translated to “friends of the people”, the Janmitran Kalyan Samiti was established in 2002 to work towards community development, with the government and community-based groups. Through their Wadi Development Program in association with the National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development (NABARD), they have successfully created more than 900 orchards, providing livelihood and basic needs to the tribal people.
